# üá´üáÆü™ñ TJ, the REST API
A minimal REST API for counting the mornings remaining in Finnish conscript service. TJ V√ÑB√Ñ! ‚òÄÔ∏è

## Minimalist Stack
- ASP.NET Core
- Swagger / OpenAPI

## Documentation
Request format: GET `/{period: int[1/2]}/{year: int}/{duration: int}`

### Pitfall
The API has hardcoded the starting dates as follows:
- First period (1/XX)
    - 6.1.XXXX
- Second period (2/XX)
    - 7.7.XXXX

This can lead to inaccuracies of a few days.

### Example Requests
- GET `1/25/255`
- GET `2/2020/165`
- GET `1/2030/347`

### Example Response
As of July 31, 2025
```json
GET /1/25/255
{
    "days": 48,
    "weeks": 6.86,
    "months": 1.6,
    "seconds": 4149191
}
```
Swagger documentation can be found at `/swagger/` endpoint when project is ran in development mode.
